// Background animation of a maze being procedurally generated from the center out. Uses
// a breadth-first traversal algorithm for the sake of a pleasing generation visualization, even
// though depth-first traversal produces a better-looking final output. This animation was inspired
// by https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/#maze-generation

// (TODO) Logic for generating a maze (bfs) in real time
module.exports.MazeGenerator = class MazeGenerator {};

// (TODO) Renders a grid onto a canvas
module.exports.GridRenderer = class GridRenderer {};
